// It applies three checks, in order of how cheaply they refuse:
//
//   - Host, against DNS rebinding. An attacker's page rebinds its own name to
//     127.0.0.1; the browser then treats the local server as same-origin and no
//     cross-origin check runs. The Host header still carries the attacker's
//     name, which is what catches it.
//   - Origin, against ordinary cross-site request forgery. A page at any origin
//     can address a loopback listener directly with a correct Host header. Only
//     the Origin header distinguishes that from a real client, and the library
//     underneath does not look at it. A request with no Origin header at all is
//     allowed: a non-browser client — which is what an MCP client normally is —
//     sends none, and the Host check still applies to it.
//   - Authorization, when this server does not fall back to its own credential.
//     Refusing at the door rather than at the forge client means a caller that
//     presents no credential cannot open a session, enumerate the tool
//     catalogue, or hold an event stream open either. The check is for presence
//     and shape only: any string under a recognised scheme passes, and it is the
