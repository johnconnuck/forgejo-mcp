Connect your AI assistant to Forgejo repositories. Manage issues, pull requests, files, and more through natural language.

## What It Does

Forgejo MCP Server is an integration plugin that connects Forgejo with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) systems. Once configured, you can interact with your Forgejo repositories through any MCP-compatible AI assistant like Claude, Cursor, or VS Code extensions.

**Example commands you can use:**
- "List all my repositories"
- "Create an issue titled 'Bug in login page'"
- "Show me open pull requests in my-org/my-repo"
- "Get the contents of README.md from the main branch"
- "Show me the latest Actions workflow runs in agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp"

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

**Option A: Using Go (Recommended)**

```bash
git clone https://git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp.git
cd forgejo-mcp
go install .
```

Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (typically `~/go/bin`) is in your PATH.

> **Note:** `go install` from the module path works from the first release
> after the module was renamed (see [Known Issues](#known-issues)):
>
> ```bash
> go install git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp/v3@latest
> ```

**Option B: Download Binary**

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp/releases).

For Arch Linux, use your favorite AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S forgejo-mcp      # builds from source
yay -S forgejo-mcp-bin  # uses pre-built binary
```

**Option C: Nix / NixOS**

 You can run the server directly using the Nix package manager:
 ```bash
 nix-shell -p forgejo-mcp
 ```
 Or using Flakes:
 ```bash
 nix run nixpkgs#forgejo-mcp
 ```

 > **Note:** `forgejo-mcp` is currently only available in the `unstable` channel and is not yet part of the 25.11 stable release.

**Option D: Container image**

A signed multi-stage OCI image is published on every release to
`git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp`. Run the server without building from source:

```bash
# Latest release
podman run --rm -i \
  -e FORGEJO_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your personal access token>" \
  git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp:latest \
  --transport stdio --url https://your-forgejo-instance.org

# Or pin a specific version
podman run --rm -i git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp:v2.24.0 --help
```

| Tag             | Meaning                                                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | Immutable — the exact release (e.g. `v2.24.0`). Use in production. |
| `latest`        | Moving — tracks the most recent release. Convenience only.     |

The image is single-arch (`linux/amd64`), signed with cosign, and carries an
attached CycloneDX SBOM. See [Verify the container image](#6-verify-the-container-image)
to check the signature and provenance before running.

### 2. Get Your Access Token

1. Log into your Forgejo instance
2. Go to **Settings** → **Applications** → **Access Tokens**
3. Create a new token with the permissions you need (repo, issue, etc.)

### 3. Configure Your AI Assistant

Add this to your MCP configuration file:

**For stdio mode** (most common):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "forgejo": {
      "command": "forgejo-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "stdio",
        "--url", "https://your-forgejo-instance.org"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FORGEJO_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your personal access token>",
        "FORGEJO_USER_AGENT": "forgejo-mcp/1.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For streamable HTTP mode** (recommended for remote/Claude.ai):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "forgejo": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

When using streamable HTTP mode, start the server first:

```bash
forgejo-mcp --transport http --url https://your-forgejo-instance.org --token <your-token>
```

**Multi-tenant HTTP mode** (optional):

You can run a single centralized `forgejo-mcp` instance and let each client provide its own token via the standard HTTP `Authorization` header. This enables serving multiple users or agents from one server.

1. Start the server (optionally without any global token):
   ```bash
   forgejo-mcp --transport http --url https://your-forgejo-instance.org
   ```
2. Clients include their specific token in each request:
   - `Authorization: token <token>` (Forgejo style)
   - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (OAuth2/MCP style)
   - Note: The scheme (`token` or `Bearer`) is case-insensitive.

See [demos/multi-tenant-http.md](demos/multi-tenant-http.md) for a copy-pasteable walkthrough.

#### Exposing the server to a network

By default the `sse` and `http` transports listen on loopback only, so nothing outside
this machine can reach them. This follows the Model Context Protocol's guidance for
locally-run servers, and it is a change in behaviour: earlier versions listened on
every network interface. The default, `localhost`, binds both loopback families, so a
client that resolves `localhost` to either `127.0.0.1` or `::1` connects. If the port is
already taken on either family the server refuses to start, rather than serve on the
other family while some clients reach whatever holds the port. A family the machine
cannot use at all — IPv6 disabled, say — is skipped, and the startup log says so.

Pass an address rather than a name — `--host 127.0.0.1` or `--host ::1` — to bind that
family alone. Use it when the other family is unusable on this machine in a way the
server cannot recognise as "absent", so that it would otherwise refuse to start.

**If you run the server in a container, or serve remote clients, you must now say so
explicitly.** The default will not accept connections from outside the machine — or,
in a container, from outside the container:

- set `--host` to an address the network can reach (`0.0.0.0` for all interfaces,
  which is the usual choice inside a container);
- and set `--allowed-hosts` to the host names your clients use. This is required, not
  optional: the server refuses to start on a network-reachable address without it,
  rather than starting and rejecting every request.

Requests are refused with `403 Forbidden` when their `Host` header is not one you
declared. Loopback names are always accepted on a loopback listener, so declaring a
proxy's hostname does not stop you connecting directly from the same machine.

**Browser clients.** A request carrying an `Origin` header is refused unless that
origin is listed in `--allowed-origins`, which is empty by default. Origins are
compared in full — scheme, host and port — because an `Origin`'s port belongs to the
page making the request, not to this server. Requests with no `Origin` header at all
are unaffected, which is the normal case: an MCP client is not a browser.

#### Authentication on `sse` and `http`

On these transports every request must carry its own `Authorization` header. A request
without one is refused with `401 Unauthorized`, rather than being served using the
server's own configured token. This is what the multi-tenant setup above expects
anyway, and it is why that setup is safe to expose.

On `stdio` the configured token still stands in for an absent header exactly as
before. Nothing about `stdio` changes.

If you run a single-user deployment over `sse` or `http` and want the old behaviour,
`--allow-operator-token-fallback` restores it. Understand what it means before you use
it: any client that can reach the port acts as the identity behind your token, without
presenting a credential. The startup log says so, loudly, whenever it is on.

**For SSE mode** (legacy HTTP-based):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "forgejo": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

When using SSE mode, start the server first:

```bash
forgejo-mcp --transport sse --url https://your-forgejo-instance.org --token <your-token>
```

## Resources

MCP resource templates expose Forgejo entities as URI-addressable resources using the `forgejo://` scheme. The URI scheme is instance-portable — the same URI form works against any Forgejo instance — and does not collide with Forgejo web links. Clients that support `resources/templates/list` and `resources/read` (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor) can resolve these URIs directly. Clients without resource-template support continue to use the tools above — no functionality is removed.

Resources do NOT replace any MCP tool — every existing list/get tool stays available; resources are an additive, URI-addressable read surface intended for auto-resolution from LLM context and for content-addressable caching of immutable entities like commits.

Resources that embed a list (issue, pr) cap the embedded array at 30 items. When truncated, the JSON payload includes a sentinel naming the corresponding `list_*` tool the caller should invoke for the full list.

**When to use resources vs tools:** prefer a resource when you have a specific sha or index in hand; prefer a tool when listing or searching.

| URI Template | Entity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `forgejo://owner/{owner}` | application/json | User or org profile addressed by login; resolves user first, falls back to org. |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}` | application/json | Repository overview: identity + counts, no embedded lists. |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/commit/{sha}` | Commit metadata | Immutable per sha. Returns JSON + markdown sidecar. sha must be 40 hex chars. |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/commit/{sha}/status` | application/json | Combined CI status for a sha: aggregate state + bounded per-context statuses (cap 30, sentinel names list tool `get_commit_statuses`). |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/issue/{index}` | application/json (+ text/markdown sidecar) | Issue metadata + rendered body + bounded recent comments (cap 30, sentinel names `list_issue_comments`). |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/issues{?state,labels,page,limit}` | application/json | Bounded list of issues as rows — index, title, state, author, labels, assignees, milestone, comment count, timestamps, due date — and **no bodies**. `state` ∈ {open, closed, all} (default `open`); `labels` comma-separated; cap 30, sentinel names `list_repo_issues`. Read the single-issue resource for a body. |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/{kind}/{index}/comment/{id}` | application/json (+ text/markdown sidecar) | Single comment by id; kind ∈ {issue, pr}. |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/{kind}/{index}/comments{?page,limit}` | application/json | Bounded comment thread with **full bodies** (the single-issue resource excerpts them at 200 chars); kind ∈ {issue, pr}; cap 30, sentinel names `list_issue_comments`. |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/pr/{index}` | application/json (+ text/markdown sidecar) | PR metadata, head/base refs, mergeability, bounded recent comments (cap 30, sentinel `list_issue_comments`) and reviews (cap 30, sentinel `list_pull_reviews`). |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/label/{id}` | application/json | Single repository label by numeric id. |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/labels{?page,limit}` | application/json | Bounded list of repository labels (cap 30, sentinel names `list_repo_labels`). |
| `forgejo://org/{org}/labels{?page,limit}` | application/json | Bounded list of organization-level labels (cap 30, sentinel names `list_org_labels`). |
| `forgejo://repo/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/{pageName}` | application/json (+ text/markdown sidecar) | Wiki page with bounded revisions and Markdown capped at 1 MiB. Use the returned normalized `page_name`; encode a literal `/` as `%2F` and spaces as `%20` in the URI (do not double-encode an already normalized name). |

Slash-separated titles such as `Guides/Setup` are useful as a subpage naming convention,
but Forgejo stores the pages in a flat list: it neither creates `Guides` automatically nor
records a parent-child relationship. Create the parent separately when readers need it, and
always address subsequent calls with the normalized `page_name` returned by create or list.
The wiki REST behavior documented here was live-tested against Forgejo
`15.0.4+gitea-1.22.0`; the complete MCP demo was replayed successfully against
`16.0.0+gitea-1.22.0`. This is the tested range, not a guarantee for every intermediate
or differently proxied deployment.

### Client Compatibility

| Client | `resources/templates/list` | `resources/read` |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | supported | supported |
| Claude Desktop | supported | supported |
| Codex | supported | supported |
| Cursor (current) | supported | supported |
| Older / minimal clients | tools only | tools only |

## Demos

End-to-end, copy-pasteable walkthroughs of the tools above — grouped by
topic (labels, attachments, time tracking, notifications, orgs, bounded
I/O code review, transport) — live in [demos/](demos/README.md). Each
demo pairs real `./forgejo-mcp --cli` invocations with the output they
produced against `codeberg.org`.

## CLI Mode

You can invoke any tool directly from the command line without running an MCP server. This is useful for shell scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and Claude Code skills.

```bash

CLI mode requires the same `FORGEJO_URL` and `FORGEJO_ACCESS_TOKEN` configuration as MCP server mode. Tool results are written as JSON to stdout by default; errors go to stderr with a non-zero exit code.

## Configuration Options

You can configure the server using command-line arguments or environment variables:

| CLI Argument | Environment Variable | Description |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `--url` | `FORGEJO_URL` | Your Forgejo instance URL |
| `--token` | `FORGEJO_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Your personal access token |
| `--debug` | `FORGEJO_DEBUG` | Enable debug mode |
| `--transport` | - | Transport mode: `stdio`, `sse`, or `http` |
| `--sse-port` | - | Port for SSE mode (default: 8080) |
| `--http-port` | - | Port for streamable HTTP mode (default: 8080) |
| `--host` | `FORGEJO_MCP_HOST` | Address the `sse` and `http` transports bind to (default: `localhost`, reachable from this machine only, binding both `127.0.0.1` and `::1`; pass one of those addresses to bind that family alone) |
| `--allowed-hosts` | `FORGEJO_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated `Host` names this server answers to; required when `--host` is not loopback |
| `--allowed-origins` | `FORGEJO_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated web origins allowed to send an `Origin` header, as full origins (`https://console.example.org`). Empty by default |
| `--allow-operator-token-fallback` | `FORGEJO_MCP_ALLOW_OPERATOR_TOKEN_FALLBACK` | On `sse`/`http`, serve requests with no `Authorization` header using this server's own token. Off by default |
| `--cli` | - | Enter CLI mode for direct tool invocation |
| `--user-agent` | `FORGEJO_USER_AGENT` | HTTP User-Agent header (default: `forgejo-mcp/<version>`) |
| - | `FORGEJO_MCP_ALLOW_FILE_PATH_UPLOAD` | Allow `file_path` attachment uploads to read the host filesystem (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`; off by default) |
| - | `FORGEJO_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT` | Confine `file_path` uploads to this directory (default: anywhere the process can read) |

Command-line arguments take priority over environment variables.

### Uploading attachments from the host filesystem

`create_issue_attachment`, `create_comment_attachment`, and
`create_release_attachment` accept either base64 `content` or a `file_path` on
the machine running `forgejo-mcp`. The path form avoids base64-expanding a large
release artifact through the MCP transport.

It is **off by default**, because it hands whatever drives the MCP client the
ability to read any file the server process can read — a prompt-injected agent
could upload `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` as a public release asset. Turn it on
deliberately, and prefer confining it:

```bash
export FORGEJO_MCP_ALLOW_FILE_PATH_UPLOAD=1
export FORGEJO_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT=/home/you/build/dist   # optional but recommended
```

With `FORGEJO_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT` set, a path that resolves outside that directory
— by being absolute, by `..`, or through a symlink — is rejected before anything
is read. Base64 `content` uploads are unaffected by either variable.

## Verifying Releases

Release archives are accompanied by a `checksums.txt` file and an optional
`checksums.txt.sig` produced by [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)
with the project's release keypair. Verifying both files lets you confirm
that the binary you downloaded was built by the project's release pipeline
and has not been tampered with in transit.

> **Heads up:** cosign signing was introduced mid-2026. Tags released
> before signing was wired up ship without a `.sig` file — verification
> applies from `v2.23.x` onward only, and only when the
> `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` secret was configured at release time.

### 1. Install cosign

Follow the upstream
[cosign installation guide](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)
for your platform. Quick paths:

```bash
# Linux/macOS — pinned binary
COSIGN_VERSION=v2.4.1
curl -sSfL -o /usr/local/bin/cosign \
  "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/${COSIGN_VERSION}/cosign-linux-amd64"
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cosign

# macOS via Homebrew
brew install cosign

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S cosign
```

Confirm:

```bash
cosign version
```

### 2. Fetch the public key

The normative source for the cosign public key is the
[`op1st-emea-b4mad`](https://codeberg.org/operate-first/op1st-emea-b4mad)
GitOps repo — same source of truth that provisions the
`cosign-signing-key-artifacts` Secret in the `op1st-pipelines` namespace
where the release pipeline runs. This is the **artifact-signing** key that
signs release blobs (`checksums.txt.sig`); it is distinct from the
**image-signing** key `cosign-signing-key-images.pub` used in §5–§6 below.
Two ways to fetch it:

**Branch-tip (live, follows future key rotations):**

```bash
curl -sSfL -o cosign.pub \
  https://codeberg.org/operate-first/op1st-emea-b4mad/raw/branch/main/manifests/applications/op1st-pipelines-tokens/cosign-signing-key-artifacts.pub
```

**Commit-pinned (tamper-evident, recommended for CI/scripts):**

```bash
curl -sSfL -o cosign.pub \
  https://codeberg.org/operate-first/op1st-emea-b4mad/raw/commit/cd3715fa8283a2069a2e3e299744a7b55b1b0260/manifests/applications/op1st-pipelines-tokens/cosign-signing-key-artifacts.pub
```

The commit-pinned permalink hashes its content into the URL — if anyone
ever rewrites the file at that commit, your download fails or mismatches.
Pin to the latest commit that you trust before adopting the key in
automation.

### 3. Download the release artifacts

Pick the tag you installed (e.g. `v2.23.1`) and grab the checksum file,
its signature, and the binary archive:

```bash
TAG=v2.23.1
VERSION="${TAG#v}"
BASE="https://git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp/releases/download/${TAG}"

curl -sSfLO "${BASE}/forgejo-mcp_${VERSION}_checksums.txt"
curl -sSfLO "${BASE}/forgejo-mcp_${VERSION}_checksums.txt.sig"
curl -sSfLO "${BASE}/forgejo-mcp_${VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz"   # adjust os/arch
```

### 4. Verify the signature, then the checksum

Cosign verifies that `checksums.txt` was signed by the holder of the
private key matching `cosign.pub`. Once the checksum file is trusted, a
plain `sha256sum -c` check confirms the archive's integrity.

```bash
# Verify checksums.txt against the signature.
cosign verify-blob \
  --key cosign.pub \
  --signature "forgejo-mcp_${VERSION}_checksums.txt.sig" \
  "forgejo-mcp_${VERSION}_checksums.txt"
# Expected: "Verified OK"

# Verify the downloaded archive against the (now-trusted) checksums.
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c "forgejo-mcp_${VERSION}_checksums.txt"
# Expected: "<archive>: OK"
```

The checksum chain transitively covers the SBOMs and other per-archive
assets — verifying `checksums.txt` once is sufficient for everything
listed inside it.

### 5. Verify SLSA provenance for the release-tools image

The release-tools container image (used internally by the Tekton release
pipeline) carries SLSA v1.0 provenance generated by [Tekton
Chains](https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/). This attestation binds the image
digest to the exact PipelineRun, git commit, and builder identity that
produced it — providing supply-chain provenance beyond what the cosign
signature alone can attest.

Fetch the `cosign-signing-key-images` public key (a separate key from the
artifact-signing key above):

```bash
curl -sSfL -o cosign-images.pub \
  https://codeberg.org/operate-first/op1st-emea-b4mad/raw/branch/main/manifests/applications/op1st-pipelines-tokens/cosign-signing-key-images.pub
```

Verify the attestation against a specific image tag:

```bash
IMAGE_TAG=v1.0.0   # substitute the release-tools tag you want to verify
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type slsaprovenance \
  --key cosign-images.pub \
  "codeberg.org/operate-first/release-tools:${IMAGE_TAG}" \
  | jq .
```

A successful run prints the decoded in-toto statement (JSON). Check that
`predicate.buildDefinition.externalParameters.runSpec.params` references the
expected git revision, and `predicate.runDetails.builder.id` shows the
Tekton Chains builder.

> **Note:** SLSA provenance attestations are available from releases built
> after forgejo-mcp-46j (Tekton Chains support) landed. Earlier image tags
> carry only the cosign signature; they have no `verify-attestation` payload.

### 6. Verify the container image

The `git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp` application image ([Option D](#1-install))
is signed by the same `cosign-signing-key-images` key as the release-tools
image, carries an attached CycloneDX SBOM, and gets SLSA v1.0 provenance from
Tekton Chains. Reuse the `cosign-images.pub` key fetched above.

Verify the signature:

```bash
IMAGE_TAG=v2.24.0   # substitute the release you are pulling
cosign verify \
  --key cosign-images.pub \
  "git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp:${IMAGE_TAG}" \
  | jq .
```

Verify the SLSA provenance attestation:

```bash
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type slsaprovenance \
  --key cosign-images.pub \
  "git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp:${IMAGE_TAG}" \
  | jq .
```

Verify and download the signed CycloneDX SBOM attestation:

```bash
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type cyclonedx \
  --key cosign-images.pub \
  "git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp:${IMAGE_TAG}" \
  | jq -r '.payload | @base64d | fromjson | .predicate' > forgejo-mcp.cdx.json
```

> The SBOM is now a **signed** in-toto attestation (`cosign attest`), not an
> unsigned `attach sbom` artifact. `cosign download sbom` no longer applies.

Because the publish pipeline pushes by digest and only promotes the
`vX.Y.Z` / `latest` tags *after* signing and SBOM attachment succeed, any tag
you can pull is guaranteed to be signed.

### Troubleshooting verification

- **`Error: no matching signatures`** — the `.sig` file is from a
  different release, or `cosign.pub` is the wrong key. Re-download both
  from the same tag.
- **`Error: cannot read file: checksums.txt.sig`** — release predates
  cosign signing, or signing was skipped that run because the secret was
  unset. Fall back to the checksum-only check (`sha256sum -c`), which
  still detects in-transit corruption but not tampering.
- **Mismatch between `cosign.pub` and the signature** — confirm you
  fetched the public key from a commit that includes the key in use at
  the time of the release. If in doubt, fetch from `branch/main`.

## Troubleshooting

**Enable debug mode** to see detailed logs:

```bash
forgejo-mcp --transport sse --url <url> --token <token> --debug
```

Or set the environment variable:

```bash
export FORGEJO_DEBUG=true
```

**Custom User-Agent**: If your Forgejo instance or proxy blocks the default `go-http-client` user agent, set a custom one:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export FORGEJO_USER_AGENT="forgejo-mcp/1.0.0"

# Or via CLI flag
forgejo-mcp --user-agent "forgejo-mcp/1.0.0" --transport sse --url <url> --token <token>
```

## Known Issues

- **`go install ...@latest` needs a post-rename release** — The Go module path
  was `codeberg.org/goern/forgejo-mcp/v2` until the forge move; Go resolves
  modules by the path declared in `go.mod`, so the
  `git.b4mad.industries/...` path only becomes installable once a release is
  tagged carrying the renamed `go.mod`. Until then, use the clone-and-build
  workflow shown in [Quick Start](#quick-start). The old
  `go install codeberg.org/goern/forgejo-mcp/v2@latest` still resolves against
  the read-only Codeberg mirror, but that mirror lags behind the current
  release — do not rely on it. The earlier `replace`-directive blocker
  ([#67](https://git.b4mad.industries/agentic-forges/forgejo-mcp/issues/67)) is
  gone; `go.mod` no longer contains one.
